# Dead by API - A Dead by Daylight data API (and database!)

## Hey!

> I'm [Lucas](https://www.lucaslamonier.com/) and I built this API for you! Download it, use on your projects, create new features, ~~fix it,~~ and have fun!
If you use this code and feel like it, show me what you made. It'll make my day to see someone putting this thing to good use! üòâ

<br/>

This API features 30 survivors, 27 killers, 197 perks, 588 add-ons, 32 items, and 29 endpoints! Updated for patch 5.7.1 (May 3rd, 2022).

Built with Next.js, MongoDB, and friends!

All Dead by Daylight content belongs to [Behaviour Interactive Inc](https://deadbydaylight.com/).

This API uses data from both in-game and the [Dead by Daylight Wiki](https://deadbydaylight.fandom.com/wiki/Dead_by_Daylight_Wiki).

This repo contains the source code of the API, the database models and schema, a script to import the data into a Mongo database, and thorough (hopefully) instructions on how to get it going.

The code of the DbA's first version (built with Node.js and Express) is in the folder `dba-v1`.

## Overview

### Data structure

The data is divided into 8 collections:

- [item](#item)
- [item-addon](#item-addon)
- [killer](#killer)
- [killer-addon](#killer-addon)
- [killer-perk](#killer-perk)
- [survivor](#survivor)
- [survivor-perk](#survivor-perk)

Click on the name of the collection to see its model or [here](#models) to go to the model section.

### Name codes

This API features a code system to identify each survivor, killer, perk, add-on, or item. The code is the element's name in lowercase and without spaces or special characters. Every document in every collection has its own unique code.

This API features a code system that helps you quickly find a specific resource. A document's code is its name in lowercase, without spaces, and special characters. Accented letters are replaced. For example: `Onry≈ç` becomes `onryo`. See more examples below.

##### Code examples

| Name                         | Code                    |
| :--------------------------- | :---------------------- |
| √âlodie Rakoto                | `elodierakoto`          |
| The Onry≈ç                    | `theonryo`              |
| Coup de Gr√¢ce                | `coupdegrace`           |
| "Restraint" - Carter's Notes | `restraintcartersnotes` |

### Field selection query

It is possible to filter which fields will be returned in your request. To do so, add a `fields` query string with the name(s) of the field(s) you want. When selecting multiple fields, separate them with commas.

Field selection is available on all routes.

`?fields=<field>`

##### Example

```http
GET /api/survivor/felixrichter?fields=name,role,perks_names
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "results": 1,
  "data": {
    "name": "Felix Richter",
    "role": "Visionary Architect",
    "perks_names": [
      "Visionary",
      "Desperate Measures",
      "Built to Last"
    ]
  }
}
```

For more details on available fields, refer to the [models](#models) section.

## Endpoints

### API route structure

Dead by API routes are divided into 3 segments: the collection name, specific or random document, and an additional parameter to retrieve documents related to the first one.

### Collection

```http
GET /api/<collection>
```

Providing only the collection name will return all of its documents. For example, `GET /api/killer` will return every single killer in the game. Note that the collection parameter is singular, passing `killers` will return an error.
[Fields](#field-selection-query) available.

### Code | Random

There are two options for the second parameter: the [code](#name-codes) or the word random.

#### Code

```http
GET /api/<collection>/<code>
```

Retrieves one single document based on the code supplied. `GET /api/survivor/felixrichter` will return Felix's document.
[Fields](#field-selection-query) available.

#### Random

```http
GET /api/item/random
```

Fetches a random sample from the given collection. The default amount is 1, but it is possible to get up to 10. In order to do that, use the amount query:

`?amount=<number>`

Passing a number below 1, higher than 10, or not a number at all, defaults to 1.

You can combo amount with [fields](#field-selection-query): `?amount=1&fields=name,description`

### Additional

Finally, the last segment retrieves data related to the collection:

- Killer: `power`, `perk`, and `addon`
- Survivor: `perk`
- Item: `addon`

‚ö† Additional queries can only be used in routes that received a `<code>` parameter. It won't work for `<random>` requests.

```http
GET /api/<collection>/<code>/<additional>
```

Examples:

```http
GET /api/killer/trapper/addon
GET /api/killer/trapper/perk
GET /api/killer/trapper/power

GET /api/survivor/felixrichter/perk

GET /api/item/flashlight/addon
```

The additional queries are meant to retrieve addons, perks, and powers from specific killers/survivors/items. You can access the collections `item-addon`, `killer-addon`, `killer-perk` and `survivor-perk` to get [all documents](#collection) or [random samples](#random).
[Fields](#field-selection-query) available.

## Running the code

In order to run this API, you need:

- Git (optional) to clone the repository
  - Alternatively, you can download the code directly from the green "code" button on the top of the page
  - Read the docs on [how to get started with Git](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

- Node (to run the thing, version 18.16.1 or higher)
  - [Download and install](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

- MongoDB (the actual database)
  - This one is a little tricky and requires a considerable amount of work
  - There are two possibilites:
      1) Run locally, [some tips here](https://zellwk.com/blog/local-mongodb/), or
      2) Run it in the magical place called [_the cloud_](https://www.mongodb.com/)

## Quickstart

#### 1. Get the code

`git clone` or download the code.

#### 2. Install dependencies

- Open your favorite CLI in the root folder of the project.
- Run `npm install`
- Wait for the dependencies to install

#### 3. Add environment variables

- At the root of your project, create a file called `.env.local`
- Inside this file add 3 variables: `USERNAME`, `PASSWORD`, and `DATABASE`
- These variables are the credential that allow your application to connect with your Mongo database
- Your file should look something like this:

```txt
USERNAME=yourusername
PASSWORD=your1password2
DATABASE=mongodb+srv://....
```

#### 4. Run it

- Run `npm run dev`
- The API should be running on `http://localhost:3000/api/`
- You can build scripts to fetch data or use API testing tools such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) and [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).


#### 5. Deploy

- To get the API online you need two services: dedicated database and a host

- For the database I recommend [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/). It is extremely unlikely that you will ever go beyond their free tier.

- For hosting, there are tons of options on the internet. My go to for Next.js is obviously [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs).

## Populating the database

This API uses the Mongoose library to handle the database. The file `src/data/db-import-script/importdevdata.js` contains one script that upload the files and other that deletes them.

This file imports dependencies, connects to the database, and reads the files with the raw data.

Note that the lines 50-57 and 71-78 are commented out. Each line refers to one collection. This way, by removing the comment toggle whether the collection should be affected or not.

Next, you need to choose which operation you want to perform. You can do that by passing an argument to the CLI command: `--import` or `--delete`.

The final command would be

```text
node src/data/db-import-script --import
```

to add the data and

```text
node src/data/db-import-script -- delete
```

The script will run and print on the log information about the status of the operation.
